# Address book using Node.js
A simple Address Book app I made while learning Node.js;

<h4>HOW TO USE IT</h4>
1. Open the terminal window and navigate to the project folder;
2. Type "npm install -g" to install the app;
3. Type "contacts add <name,number>" to add a contact (where name and number are the ones from the contact);
4. Type "contacts find <name>" to find a contact (where name is the name of the contact you're looking for);
 
This is a simple app. It will store all his data in a single JSON file in the user's home folder.
